<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>When I started working full-time as data scientist, I realized that I started lacking the explorations which are necessary for growth. 
By exploration, I mean trying new things, getting out of your comfort zone and putting yourself under pressure where you are very likely to fail.
These explorations are meant to be diverse experiments which bring in new perspectives. For me hackathons have been a such kind of experiments. <br>
By teaming up with people I have never met before, discussing ideas while being honest and critical, considering others opinion, after intense discussions 
urging everyone to agree with one general idea, formulating plan and dividing tasks among the team, working hard to fulfill the initial vision
and most of all presenting the complex problem-solutions within a certain time limit in front of big audience; has always been very daring experience.<br>
Of course, we have never been able to completely achieve initial vision but surprisingly, many times we were able to engineer, develop and validate the 
idea enough to impress the audience and win some prize under certain category.</p>
